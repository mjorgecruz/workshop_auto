# Seminar on Automative Maintenance

During my last year in my Mechanical Engineering degree I took part in the creation of an Association of students of mechanical engineering at the faculty where I integrated the pedagogical department.</br>
Apart from other responsibilities related to creating a platform to better gather knowledge related to the course, I also identified a few areas of interest for the students that were not focused during the course.</br>
With this in mind, a colleague (Luis Araujo) and I decided to create a first seminar on car maintenance. The idea was for the Association to carry on creating workshops as such after.
